<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

They can study the project's code structure, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to learn how to create a responsive website using the Bootstrap framework. Additionally, the project can serve as a source of inspiration for design and layout ideas, as well as showcase how to incorporate different design elements and features into a portfolio website, such as a navigation bar, responsive image gallery, and contact form. The new developer can also use the project as a starting point and customize it to fit their own unique skills and projects, allowing them to quickly build and launch their own portfolio website.
